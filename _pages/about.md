Helllo I'm Chen Qifan. I'm currently a student at The Ohio State University with focus on computational mathematics. I received a B.S. degree in mathematics with First Class Honours from The Chinese university of Hong Kong in 2021. My undergraduate supervisor is Prof. [[Jun Zou]](https://www.math.cuhk.edu.hk/people/academic-staff/zou). My graduate supervisor is Prof. [[Yulong Xing]](https://people.math.osu.edu/xing.205/).

My research interests broadly lie in Numerical Analysis, Partial Differential Equation and AI for Science. Recent projects are on Temporal discretizations for discontinuous Galerkin(DG) methods with DG's big family and Data-driven modeling of systems driven by differential equations with group of Prof. [[Dongbin Xiu]](https://sites.google.com/view/dongbin-xiu). I'm actively looking for discussions and possible collaborations on interesting topics.

I'm co-organizing the [[Student Computational Math Seminar]](https://u.osu.edu/studentcomputationalmathseminar/) at OSU. Feel free to contact me if you want to give a talk.

I have a wide variety of hobbies such as badminton, Chinese flute and vedio games. I'm a fan of Chengdu Rongcheng FC.

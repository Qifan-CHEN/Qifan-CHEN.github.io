Helllo I'm Chen Qifan. I'm currently a student at The Ohio State University with focus on computational mathematics. I received a B.S. degree in mathematics with First Class Honours from The Chinese university of Hong Kong in 2021. My undergraduate supervisor is Prof. Jun Zou. My graduate supervisor is Prof. Yulong Xing.

My research interests broadly lie in Numerical Analysis, Partial Differential Equation and AI for Science. Recent projects are on Temporal discretizations for discontinuous Galerkin methods and Data-driven modeling of systems driven by differential equations. Actively looking for discussions and possible collaborations on interesting topics.

I'm co-organizing the Student Computational Math Seminar at OSU. Our webpage is https://u.osu.edu/studentcomputationalmathseminar/. Feel free to contact me if you want to give a talk.

I have a wide variety of hobbies such as badminton, Chinese flute and vedio games. I'm a fan of Chengdu Rongcheng FC.

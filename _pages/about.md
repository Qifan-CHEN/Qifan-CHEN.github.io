Helllo I'm Chen Qifan. I'm currently a 4th year PhD candidate at The Ohio State University with focus on computational mathematics. My graduate supervisor is Prof. [Yulong Xing](https://people.math.osu.edu/xing.205/). Before that I received a B.S. degree in mathematics with First Class Honours from The Chinese university of Hong Kong in 2021. My undergraduate supervisor is Prof. [Jun Zou](https://www.math.cuhk.edu.hk/people/academic-staff/zou). 

My research interests broadly lie in Numerical Analysis, Partial Differential Equation and AI for Science. Recent research projects focus  on Temporal discretizations for discontinuous Galerkin(DG) methods with DG's big warm family and Data-driven modeling of systems driven by differential equations with group of Prof. [Dongbin Xiu](https://sites.google.com/view/dongbin-xiu). I'm actively looking for discussions and possible collaborations on interesting topics.

I'm co-organizing the [Student Computational Math Seminar](https://u.osu.edu/studentcomputationalmathseminar/) at OSU. Feel free to contact me if you want to give a talk.

I have a wide variety of hobbies such as badminton, Chinese flute and vedio games. I'm a fan of Chengdu Rongcheng FC.
